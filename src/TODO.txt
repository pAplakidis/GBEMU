IMPORTANT NOTE:
if you're running the boot rom then you start at $0, but to directly boot a ROM you should set the initial PC to $100
prefixed opcodes are fairly simple too, the game boy only uses one prefix ($CB), so if you encounter $CB when fetching an opcode, you fetch the next byte and decode/execute that byte according to the CB-prefixed opcode table (as opposed to the regular opcode table)
